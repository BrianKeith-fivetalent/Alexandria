It was in Alexandria, during the six hundred years beginning around 300 B.C., that human beings, in an important sense, 
began the intellectual adventure that has led us to the shores of the cosmic ocean. 
The city was founded by Alexander the Great who encouraged respect for alien cultures and the open-minded pursuit of knowledge.
